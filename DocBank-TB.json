            "The upsilon, Υ(nS), is the S-wave spin-triplet state, n3S , of bottomonium with the well 1 − −− established quantum number of IGJPC = 0 1 [4].",
            "The typical total widths of the upsilons below the kinematical open-bottom threshold (where the radial quantum number n = 1, 2 and 3) are a few tens of keV (see Table I), at least two orders of magnitude lower less than ¯ those of bottomonium above the BB threshold.",
            "(note that for simplicity, the notation Υ(nS) will denote the Υ(1S), Υ(2S) and Υ(3S) mesons in the following content if not speciﬁed explicitly) As it is well known, the Υ(nS) meson decays primarily through the annihilation of ¯ the bb pairs into three gluons, which are suppressed by the phenomenological Okubo-Zweig- → Iizuka rule [5–7].",
            "The allowed G-parity conserving transitions, Υ(nS) ππΥ(mS) and → ≥ ≥ Υ(nS) ηΥ(mS) where 3 n > m 1, are greatly limited by the compact phase spaces, − because the mass diﬀerence m m is just slightly larger than 2m , and m Υ(3S) Υ(2S) π Υ(2S) − m is just slightly larger than m .",
            "The coupling strengths of the electromagnetic Υ(1S) η and radiative interactions are proportional to the electric charge of the bottom quark, Q = b − | | 1/3 in the unit of e .",
            "Besides, the Υ(nS) meson can also decay via the weak interactions ∼ O − within the standard model, although the branching ratio is small, about 2/τ Γ (10 8) B Υ [4], where τ and Γ are the lifetime of the B meson and the total width of the Υ(nS) B Υ u,d,s → meson, respectively.",

            "We will consider four cases, in increasing order of “model independence”.", 
            "The first case is standard ΛCDM gravity (Y = 1), and σ8 and initial conditions both fixed to the fiducial model, σ8 = 0.83 [24] and α = 1. Here the only free parameter is therefore Ωm,0 (with an uniform prior in 0, 1).", "The second case is like the first one but with marginalization over σ8.", 
            "This case serves mainly to isolate the effect of the σ8-marginalization and to see how much the best fit of Ωm,0 changes if σ8 is estimated from the fσ8(z) data themselves and not from Planck.", 
            "From now on, we always fix the background evolution E to a ΛCDM with Ω (bg) m,0 = 0.3, in agreement with observations and close to the Planck best fit [24], and neglecting any uncertainty on it and we always include the marginalization over σ8.",

            "Finally, the fourth case is like the third one but now the initial growth rate α is left free to vary.", 
            "The results for the first and second cases are shown on the left panel of Fig. (1). At 68% c.l., the uncertainty on Ωm,0 increases from 0.03 to roughly 0.10 when marginalizing over σ8 while for σ8 itself we find σ8 = 0.76+0.06−0.10, smaller than but compatible with the Planck value.", 
            "On the right panel, we plot the fσ8 data points from the galaxy surveys with their respective error bars in comparison with the ΛCDM model and with the best fits of all the cases.",

            "In particular, a large Yˆ can be compensated by a large negative α, while small Yˆ are compatible with large positive values.", 
            "Large negative values of α mean that overdensities can become underdensities at some point in time; although this might appear pathological at first sight, it does not contradict any observation at linear scales and should not be arbitrarily excluded. Within 3σ, a small Yˆ is compatible with any value of α since in this limit the perturbation equation becomes effectively first order in δ 0.",
            "The conclusion of this section is that current data put hardly any constraint on Yˆ .",
